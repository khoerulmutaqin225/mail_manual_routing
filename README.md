![Odoo Logo](./static/description/icon.png)

Sometimes Odoo does not manage to address incoming messages. For example, it happens when your customer doesn't reply to a message but sends a direct email to your catchall address. In that case, such an email is completely lost, and clients become more and more irritated. This tool solves the issue. With this app, you get full control over all lost messages and you can attach any Odoo message to a proper document thread.
